# Why data visualisations

-   communicate results
-   explore data
-   if done correctly: efficient way of processing & remembering data, becaue reduce the cognitive load and take it easy into long-term memory → because we have a limited working memory and keep in mind \~ 7 variables
-   Reducing cognitive load makes the audience:
-   More willing to read your analysis
-   More likely to understand the data/results
-   More prone to accept the results
-   More likely to remember them
-   Often the only part of the analysis that the audience ever sees.

## How to communicate via visualization?

-   How do we make sure that the graphs we make transfer:
-   The right part of the data, and; with the less effort possible? ( minimizes cognitive load)
-   First step in a data visualization task: Write down the main message you want to convey

**Central questions:**

1.  What are the main elements of a graph? (labels, dots, bars, facets ...)

2.  What type of plot should you use?

-   Barplots for a categorical and a numerical variable, compare the frequency
-   Scatterplots for 2 numerical variables, shows covariances and relations of the two variables

3.How can we make a plot look more professional? - take it as minimal as possible, no "junk", no Color, if no color is needed, scale comprehensible

4.  How to guide the reader?

-   highlight the central aspect

## Criteria for good graphs and visualization

Guidelines for routine plotting:

-   properly chosen format and design
-   use words, numbers and drawing together
-   display an accessible complexity of detail
-   avoid content-free decoration
-   maximize the "data-to-ink" ratio
-   simplify, remove everything that is not necessary
-   no cherry picking in data, visuals must be chosen in relation to data, example: Age cohorts in Barcharts, longtidual changes in point charts
-   reduce aesthetics to a minimal and use colour and so on only if it has a meaning.
-   humans ability to see contrast is stronger for monochrome images than for color
-   using color in data visualization introduces a number of other complications, because color contains the hue (Farbton) and a chrominance ot chroma (intesity or vividness of the color):
    -   how bright an object looks depends partly on the brightness of objects near it.
    -   distance of variables should be found also in a perceptually sense in the choice of colors, not only in a numerical one
-   "preattentive pop-out": Some objects in our visual field are easier to see than others → indicate with shapes, color & position.
-   Most people see the Poisson-generated pattern (a random generated pattern) as having more structure, or less 'randomness', than the Matérn (an equally distributed), whereas the reverse is true.
-   humans are always looking for structure, the tendency of infer relationships, "gestalt rules":
    -   Similarity: Things that look alike seem to be related.
    -   Connection: Things that are visually tied to one another seem to be related.
    -   Continuity: Partially hidden objects are completed into familiar shapes.
    -   Closure: Incomplete shapes are perceived as complete.
    -   Figure and Ground: Visual elements are taken to be either in the foreground or the background.
    -   Common Fate: Elements sharing a direction of movement are perceived as a unit.
-   humans can identify and estimate percentages of differences of two sizes for graphs on a different level, here the results of testing:

**Pracitcal advice**

Reduce cognitive load: - Removing unnecessary clutter - More professional/aesthetically pleasant Contrast: - Eliminate unnecessary lines (all frames, use gray grid lines, etc) - ’t use a gray background - White space is your friend (allows for “breathing”) - Enlarge the labels - Use vector graphics (svg/pdf/eps) to avoid blurry figures –\> Edit them in AI or Inkscape Repetition: Be consistent in different figures Alignment: Make sure you align subplots/labels Proximity: When possible, label data directly (instead of using legends)

## Guide the reader

-   We read plots in a Z-shaped flow: top-left to top-right to bottom-left to bottom-right

With this elements:

The most useful pre-attentive attribute: - Increases contrast - Allows for consistency (same country with the same color)

Color affect emotion and this is culture-dependent. Some responses are nearly universal - Warm colors –\> alive/alert - Blue colors –\> calming/focus

Color for the colorblinding: https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40

In addition of highlighting, colours can be used to: - Represent categories (not more than 4 colors) - Represent values: - Only if necessary (i.e. you are using the x and y axis for more important variables) - Not accurate (show trends)

-   left, too much: you are lost
-   right, your attention is guided to the important aspects

-   Qualitative: categorial data
-   Sequential: The minimum or maximum is important
-   Diverging: The middle value is the important one, which comparison is drawn on

## how ggplot function works

![](figures/2.%20ggplot%20function.png){width="200"}

required library: `library(tidyverse)`

In R, grammar of graphics is implemented in `ggplot()`, a function in the `ggplot2` package.

Elements of a graph:

-   The data: ggplot(data = gapminder)
-   Aesthetic mappings (position, shape, color, …) – map variables to influence visual channels: mapping = aes(x = gdp, y = pop)
-   Geometric objects (points, lines, bars, …) – use those mappings: + geom_point()
-   Labels (titles, caption, axes labels): + labs(x = "GDP", y="Population")

`ggplot()` is the *function* to plot `aes` or *astehtic mappings* is the logical connection bewtween your data and the plot element `geom` defines the type of plot like

-   `geom_point`
-   `geom_bar`
-   `geom_boxplot`
-   in this function additional elements could be added like scales, labels and so on

ggplot function is additive, you add layer by layer, e. g.:

```         
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))
p + geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "gam") +
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar)
```
